# tacos2text

Personnal code to load a text2vect model writen in explicit text format and use it to rename a tree that represents question from a skill assesment test (each leaf has a text, the nodes are renammed with an adjective/job-name meant to describe the associated leafs).

Also equiped to allow interaction with the said tree. As the user answers question, an algorithm select the next question to ask in order to manage exploration an exploitation (UCT algorithm) : the user can answer only part of the test and the algorithm will have efficiently gathered data on the skills he likes.sssssyuc
